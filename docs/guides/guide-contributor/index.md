## Key topics

Here is a list of broad topics and challenges that you can address while
working with us:

- Aid the **development of consensus-driven community standards** for the

  applications** that implement these standards, with the goal of enabling
  thousands of professional users in academia, the public healthcare sector and
  industry to analyze sensitive data in a federated cloud environment
- Support the **production-grade, containerized deployment** of these services
  on modern infrastructure in private, public, hybrid and multicloud settings

  individually and in combination, including the flow of authentication and

however, to be able to join in any given year, you should do so at the latest
when the host organization and projects are announced early in the calendar
year (check the [official timeline][gsoc-timeline] for the exact date).
