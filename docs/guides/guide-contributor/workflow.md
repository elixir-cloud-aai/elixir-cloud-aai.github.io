# Workflow

To start working with us, please follow these simple steps:

1. Join [:custom-github-black: GitHub][github-join].
2. Check out our [repositories][elixir-cloud-aai-github] and [open
   issues][elixir-cloud-aai-issues].
3. Join our [:custom-slack: Slack board][elixir-cloud-aai-slack] (please [let us
   know](../../about/contact.md) if the link expired).
4. Join the [`#oss-community`][elixir-cloud-aai-slack-channel-oss] and leave
   a short message about yourself. Please include (1) your relevant skills and
   experience level, (2) your GitHub username, (3) your email address (e.g.,
   for calendar invitations), and (4) the repositories or issues you are most
   interested in. If you can't decide, no problem, just indicate that you are
   open to work on anything and we will suggest some issues for you.
5. Once we have added you to our [GitHub organization][elixir-cloud-aai-github],
   you can assign yourself to an issue.
6. Please carefully read the [guidelines](general-guidelines.md) below, as well
   as any relevant [language-specific guidelines](language-specific/index.md).
   If you are managing a project, please also consult the [project management
   guidelines](managing-projects.md).
7. Start coding! :computer:

!!! note "Privacy note"

    If you do not want to share your GitHub username and/or your email address
    in the public channel, please send a direct message to a
    [project lead][elixir-cloud-aai-contributors] instead.

!!! note "Always work on issues"

    If you want to propose code changes and there is no corresponding issue
    available, please make sure to open an issue first and get some feedback
    from project leads. This is to avoid the frustration of putting in work for
    nothing in case the project leads had other plans.

??? note "One-time contributors"

    If you like, you can skip steps 3. to 5. and raise pull requests from
    forks. Note, however, that some CI workflows may not (yet) be fully
    supported for pull requests raised from forks, which may delay the review
    process and the merging of your changes.
