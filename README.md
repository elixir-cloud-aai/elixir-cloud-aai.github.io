## Development

For ease, certain scripts have been abbreviated in `Makefile`, make sure that
you have installed the dependencies before running the commands.

> **Note**: `make` commands are only available for Unix-based systems.

To view the commands available, run:

```sh
make
```

Here are some commands that you might find useful:

make i
```
